				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As of lately we have had a few users where they compose a message in outlook and when they hit send the message goes to their outbox to send but it remains there and nothing you do will release it. However when the user logs into Outlook Web Access the message sends perfectly fine. This immediately indicates that the issue is client side in Outlook.</p>
<p>I must have spent ages trying to get Outlook to send but eventually a colleague of mine find a setting deep within Outlook which fixed the issue of emails not being sent and stuck in the outbox. The setting is as follows:</p>
<p>Outlook -> Tools -> Options -> Preferences (Tab) -> Email Options (Button) -> Advanced Email Options&#8230; (Button)</p>
<p>Then when there make sue that the follow tick box is un-checked: &#8220;In folders other than the Inbox, save replies with original message&#8221;.</p>
<p>Not sure what this does but when we un-tick it mail flow starts working again.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever emptied your deleted items folder in Microsoft Outlook and realised you really did need that email you just deleted?</p>
<p>Well your in luck as it can be recovered, providing that the Microsoft Exchange Server has been told to keep deleted emails for a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Firstly you need to make a registry edit on your local machine to make the option available to you in Outlook.</p>
<p>1) Close Outlook<br />
2) Run Regedit<br />
3) Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Options<br />
4) Add a new DWORD called <strong>DumpsterAlwaysOn</strong><br />
5) Set the DWORD to 1.<br />
6) Close Regedit and launch Outlook.<br />
7) Go to Tools->Recover Deleted Items&#8230;</p>
<p>There we have it. If you are not happy making changes to your registry yourself then you can use the following reg file that will make the change for you</p>
<p>[HTML]<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Options]<br />
&#8220;DumpsterAlwaysOn&#8221;=dword:00000001<br />
[/HTML]</p>
