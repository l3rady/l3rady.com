				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a user installs Skype it auto installs some plugins to Internet Explorer and Firefox, that when it sees a telephone number on the webpage a user is viewing it will replace the number and surround it in its own formatting. Now a user can disable this function but as a web designer/developer you cannot guarantee that all your website visitors have it disabled. For those users that don’t have it disabled a nicely designed and placed telephone number in your design is replaced with an ugly and out-of-place number. Yuk! I did some searching and all the posts I could find only said how to disabled the plugin which I didn’t want. I want to disable the plugin or disable the effects of the plugin for all browsers viewing the site I was developing.</p>
<p>I then came across this code:</p>
<pre class="brush:html">&lt;meta name="SKYPE_TOOLBAR" content="SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE" /&gt;</pre>
<p>Put looks like Skype has updated and this code no longer works. For all my web design work I always work with a reset.css style sheet that is like my common settings for CSS that I use in all web development. Well I stumbled across some CSS you can use to hide the effects of the Skype plugin. Here is the nice bit of CSS code that has found its way into my reset.css style sheet:</p>
<pre class="brush:css">/**** GET LOST SKYPE! ****/
span.skype_pnh_container {display:none !important;}
span.skype_pnh_print_container {display:inline !important;}</pre>
<p>Hope it helps you out</p>
