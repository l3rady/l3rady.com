		<description><![CDATA[Hi Scott,
I found your plugin l3rady-cpt-structure-helper on gisthub, following an artice from Steve Taylor (http://sltaylor.co.uk/blog/adding-custom-post-type-landing-pages-yoast-breadcrumbs/). The plugin works great, thanks a lot for sharing! As I&#039;m using WPML for translation, I wonder if it is possible somehow to set a landing page for each language?
Would be so great to make that work!! :)
Thanks &amp; Cheers,
Regina]]></description>
